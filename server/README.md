# Setting up environment variables

Environment variables need to be setup with the prefix `VENDING_MACHINE_`.
<br/>
For example:

```sh
VENDING_MACHINE_PORT = 8000
```

They can be inserted directly from the process or loaded from .env file while develpoing.
<br/>
To load from .env file, copy the .env.example to .env and make modifications as needed.

```
cp .env.example .env
```
